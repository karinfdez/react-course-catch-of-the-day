Files from the React For Begginers course. The code in this repo is a result of following along with the video course.


## To Start

**Note** - one of the dependencies is currently not working with Node.js 10.3, please use [version 9.11.1](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v9.11.1/) (or around that, 8.x and 9.x should work fine) until then.
